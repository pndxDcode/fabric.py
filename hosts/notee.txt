## sumble accross a problem when tried to replace the database server
## the paramiko (ssh) is automaticaly assign ssh-key to known-host in ~/.ssh/known-hosts
## so when tried to replaced the old database server with the new one but with the same address 172.17.0.3
## it trew an exeption error like mith or something.
## work around for this problem is to remove the old ssh-known-hosts in ~/.ssh/known-hosts, and generate a new one
# 'ssh-keygen -R 172.17.0.3' // replaced the old known-hosts with the new one
